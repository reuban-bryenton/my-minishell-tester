# my-minishell-tester
 I made this tool to test the minishell1, 2 and 42sh projects in my first year at epitech. Feel free to share and use it yourself.

## Current tests
 🗒️ Please only use this as a guide and note that this is not an official testing tool.
 Currently I only have the tests for minishell1 and it is currently incomplete.
 In version 1.2 I will update the readme to contain info on how to add your own tests.

## installation

 To use this script copy your binary from your minishell project (in this case the example will be mysh) and run the following code:

 ``python3 minishell1_tester.py ./mysh``

 and to get help use:

 ``python3 minishell1_tester.py -h``

<br>

 The output should look simalar to this:

 ``Testing [...] tests...``

 ``✅ Test [...]: Test passed.``

 ``...``

 ``✅ Passed: ...``

 ``❌ Failed: ...``
